***(Text classification and Fashion MNIST classification)***

Authors: Roberto Bigazzi, Filippo Collini

Every info about the project is inside the .pdf file.
Cloning the project you need to retrain some models (running the benchmark files will tell you which models are missing) because those models violate the 100MB file size limitation of Github.

Code we borrowed and tutorials we used:
